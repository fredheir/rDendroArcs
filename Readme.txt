Code to create visualisations of topic models as described at http://quantifyingmemory.blogspot.com/2013/11/visualising-structure-in-topic-models.html

Running dendroArcs2.R should reproduce illustrations in out.pdf and out.pdf.png (the latter being the dendrogram of topic correlations)

Sample data is from 337 Izvestiia and Gazeta.ru articles where 'Egypt' is a top-ten keyword (ranked by TF-IDF), printed between 2003 and March 2013.
